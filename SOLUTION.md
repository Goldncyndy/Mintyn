CODE ORGANIZATION AND REFACTORING TO ENHANCE THE PROJECT

During development, i used the Model View Controller(MVC) code organization to organise the folders and structure of the project because of the scope and nature of the project. However, as the project grows and with other functionalities added or specified by the client I would use a suitable code organization and refactoring to make it easy to read and locate components of the project.

Other system architecture includes:  MVVM, MVP, VIPER, VIP etc. I would employ any of them depending on the project at hand.

UnitTest, UITest module and Dark/Light Mode switch would be completely implemented to enhance the project, if time permits.
